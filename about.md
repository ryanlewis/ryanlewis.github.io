My name is Ryan Lewis. I am a husband, father and a Contract Developer. I primarily work with JavaScript, ReactJS, .NET and other web-based technologies. I'm a Level 2 certified Umbraco developer.

I previously worked at [Epiphany Search](http://www.epiphanysearch.co.uk), a leading digital agency based in Leeds. While there I have worked with many household brands on large public facing websites.
